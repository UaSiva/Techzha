<h1> Thoughts on Apple Vision Pro </h1>

<h3> 8/10 - First Gen Product. But, </h3>

<br>

<br>

<p>

If the Vision Pro was made of plastic instead of glass and aluminum and weighs half it is now, will the experience be better ???

<br>

Is flashy-ness 
holding us back from a good product 
and a great experience ?

<br>

If it was half the weight, they could have put in the battery inside and made the pocket battery optional !

<br>

Just imagine introducing Spacitial Computing to the world without a hanging cable !

<br>

Vision Pro : light , powerful , $2499 (because of no glass and aluminum).

<br>

Remove the entire lenticular display replace it with bright oled showing memoji eyes with movement.

<br>


Vision Pro : light , powerful , fun , $1999 !

<br> <br>

Anyway, 

<br>

Apple Vision Pro One line review:
It’s the best Mixed Reality headset but that’s not match for the real world “reality” 
much like its price of $3500.

<br>

It’s the best that’s ever been.
No one’s even close.

<br>

It’s a 7/10 review from Verge.

<br>

That might look only above average.
But think about it.

<br>


7/10 for “Replacing Reality” ! 

<br>

AND augmenting it with useful software features !!!

<br>

Doing 7/10 job of THAT is a “pretty good start” !

<br>

Both Meta and Apple headsets are good in their own ways

<br>

But Apple Vision Pro is in a league of its own !!!!!

<br>

<h2>Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra : Very Good but Little Weird.</h2>
<br>
<p>Both Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra (especially the ultra) are such good products in a very weird screen size and aspect ratio and colors.
<br>
Stellar Display, Leading Camera and humongous battery. 
<br>  
But starting at $1300 and $999. Yikes.
<br>
Not compelling when there is flagship like 
OnePlus 8 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro and Pixel 4XL.
<br>
The S Pen is now down to Apple Pencil’s longtime 9ms delay. But is the S Pen used by anyone? 
<br>
Does it make sense in a product that “ small “ when there is not enough software to take advantage of it ?
<br>
I think and hope the S flagship this year would at-least be compelling.
<br>
<h3>Sidenote:</h3>
Also I think we are getting a glimpse of what can happen when companies have made their best 
<br>
possible product a few years ago and can’t improve upon it, because nothing is left to be improved !
<br>
Samsung has been the leader in diminishing bezels. They have done it.
<br>
Now what ? The improvements are very very incremental to be compelling.

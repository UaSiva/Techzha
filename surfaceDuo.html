<p>Coming Soon: Views on LG Wing foldable smartphone...<p>
 
<h1> BSTT (Bored Students Talk Tech)</h1>

<h2>Microsoft Surface Duo : Phenomenal Hardware but Optimised Apps due.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Dat 360° Hinge is so awesome, it single handedly makes the Duo possible and fun to use.</h2>
<br>
<h3>True Multitasking</h3>
<p>Running two apps , one on each screen in a “Truly” multitasking kinda way where,
<br> 
Each app get a large display and you can truly consume each app fully and simultaneously, which is very powerful.</p>
<br><br>  
<h3>Larger Canvas</h3>  
<p>The large canvas not only helps two different apps take advantage of the space, <br>
Even a standalone app can use the place effectively if optimised.<br>
Like the window’s photos app has photo thumbnails on the left and on clicking the photo <br>
it opens in full resolution on the right so on the left you can still continue to browse your albums.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Spanning</h3>
<p>Apps taking advantage of the two screens , ie. spanning two screens.</p> 
<p>Microsoft said, All of window’s official apps and select third party apps have taken advantage of the Duo’s <br>
dual displays and also infer what state the device is in , such as both screens open , fully folded and proper up with one display on each side.</p>
<br><br>
<h3> Moments </h3>
It’s all about the Moments !
<br>
<p>The moment where : </p>
<ul>
  <li>Twitter and Instagram are open one on each display, that’s cool.</li>
  <li>A YouTube link clicked on Location on one display , opens up on Google Maps <br>
      on the second display without disturbing the first display. <br>
      That’s really cool.</li>
  <li>A reading app and Notes app are open one on each display, which is very useful for students.</li>
  <li>The keyboard on the left screen is pinned to the left and right screen on the right,<br> 
      which is very thoughtful and handy.<br>                                                          
      Also the “Nintendo DS mode” for the keyboard is handy too.</li>
  <li>Video conferencing is on one screen and YouTube video on another, which very powerful.</li>
  <li>Panos sets the Duo down on the the table , which can look simple but it so convenient to have that feature.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>  
 
<h3>The sprinkled mistakes</h3>
<p>The press briefing was done with great taste but with sprinkled mistakes</p>
<p>Why is the press briefing of the world’s 2nd most valuable company done with shaky handheld shots 
and look less coordinated like the shaky footage when switched over to the R&D labs.</p>
<p>Also the entire initial demo of Panos should have been like Shilpa’s , Panos sitting down, 
   with a camera behind him looking over his shoulders. and he could have gotten up at the moment 
   when he had to prop up the Duo on the bench for the "watching videos together" moment and 
   to show all this fits in our pocket.</p>
  <p>
  The reason for My Phone app to exist at all is confusing, won’t sending notifications of the inactive Duo 
  a nearby active Surface Desktop alone enough ? 
  Can the Desktop infer the notifications and open the fully fledged windows apps which share state parity 
  with the corresponding android apps on the Duo.
</p>
<br>
  <h3>Notes to Microsoft</h3>
  <p>People are gonna think Windows is powering their Duo you guys need to be running ads showing 
    that its running Android and it effortlessly and beautifully integrates with windows.</p>

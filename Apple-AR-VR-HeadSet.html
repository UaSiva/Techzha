<h1>Apple AR/VR Headset : maybe longer in the making than you think.</h1>
<h3>Miniaturization , Apple Silicon , few killer apps is all they need right ?</h3>

<br>

<br>
<h3>FAN-LESS SILICON</h3>
<p>&quot; Fan-less MacBook Air performance on par with $5000 iMac Pro &quot; <h2>- levels of craziness</h2>
</br>is what can make the tech that&#39;s literally around the ear , noise-free.
</p>
<br><br>  
<h3>MINIATURIZATION</h3>  
<p>Making the unnecessarily small 38mm Apple Watch I think personally was the challenge Apple took up</br> 
  as warm up runs for the <h2>&quot;marathon of miniaturization&quot;</h2> that is required in a product like AR/VR headset</br> 
  which has the highest end technologies in the &quot;Spring of their Life&quot; to occupy the smallest of the space.</p>
<br><br>

<h3>APPLE SILICON</h3>  
<p>With iPhones chips easily surpassing performance of laptop chips ,</br> 
  Apple Silicon is sure to play a huge role which can literally</br> 
  <h2>"make or break the illusion"</h2> by handling the buttery-smoothness of the AR/VR experience, maybe 240fps voxel refresh rate ?</br>
</p>
<br><br>

<h3>BATTERY EFFICIENCY</h3>  
<p>
  &quot;M1 MacBook Pro using only 17% battery for 5min 8K at 60fps whereas comparable Intel notebook&#39;s battery died before exporting&quot;</br>
  <h2>- levels of craziness </h2></br> is what can prolong extended immersive AR/VR sessions.</br>

<h3>AIRPODS (2016)</h3>  
<p>&quot;Supercomputer in the ear&quot;-miniaturization aside , AirPods felt like the dream wireless product Steve Jobs<br> 
  <h2>manifested into reality across lifetimes.</h2> A wireless product the minute it was unveiled became obvious and<br> 
  set the standard. Headset should be the ultimate wireless product to be non-clumsy.<br>
</p>

<br><br>

<h3>SPATIAL AUDIO (2020)</h3>  
<p>In the words of Steve , &quot;a pair of earphones can sorta simulate a 5.1 Surround Sound<br> 
  <h2>there is nothing like that for vision&quot;</h2>Spatial Audio only tries to enhance this audio experience<br> 
  <h2>AR/VR headset is the vision part coming after 20 YEARS !!!</h2><br>
</p>

<br><br>

<h3>LiDAR (2020)</h3>  
<p>LiDAR first introduced 2020 iPad Pro which drastically improved AR experience from waving around the device to<br>
  <h2>making the device instant AR ready.</h2> Despite being less than 5m LiDAR range<br>
  <h2>It enhanced the experience an order of magnitude at least.</h2><br>
</p>
<br><br>

<h3>TRANSPARENCY MODE (2019)</h3>  
<p>AirPods Pro transparency mode is the &quot;easier&quot; part because its audio and sampling audio at the rate<br> 
  of 48,000 times per second is sort of easy <h2>Doing that to RGB High-Res , High Frame rate data is order(s) of magnitude</h2><br> 
  more difficult , that&#39;s why &quot;transitioning&quot; using the the rumored &quot;reality dial&quot;<br> <h2>could be a 
  possibility only with the high performance of Apple Silicon.</h2><br>
</p>
<br><br>

<h3>U1 Chip (2019)</h3>  
<p>Again introduced 4 years ago to have devices &quot;know&quot; the directional<br> 
  presence of other Apple devices, <h2>enabling witchcraft like Universal control</h2><br> 
  the headset has to also &quot;work upon&quot; existing apple devices ,<br> 
  <h2>my guess floating iOS live activities when seen through the AR/VR headset.</h2><br>
</p>
<br><br>

<h3>LiveText (2021)</h3>  
<p><h2>Another blackmagic-esque feature , Imagine LiveText in Ar/VR<br>
  I can imagine grabbing text from surroundings even without touching a surface !<br></h2></p>
<br><br>

<h3>Live Activities (2022)</h3>  
<p><h2>Re-Incarnartion Dashboard from OS X in AR/VR ?<br> 
  I believe Live Activities and Widgets can do that.</h2></p>
<br><br>

<h3>EDUCATION IMPLICATIONS !!!</h3>  
<p><h2>I think this will have an &quot;iPad level&quot; impact in education<br> 
  when the price starts to go down over the years.</h2></p>
<br><br>

<h3>BONUS !!!</h3>  
<p><h4>Privacy focused On Device processing, machine learning can be one of the key USP of this headset.<br><br>

  Overheating practically made a thing of past by Apple Silicon important especially for something on your face.<br><br>
  
  Did Jonny Ive design this AR/VR headset atleast even partially ??<br><br>
  Excited Music of product intro , remember AirPods intro music &#128525;<br><br>
  
  
  
  Special Handling of Apple devices in the AR frame.<br><br>
  Can be pitched as a laid back device like the iPad , like Steve did with a couch. &#128525; <br><br>
  
  
  
  Door detection from iPhone<br><br>
